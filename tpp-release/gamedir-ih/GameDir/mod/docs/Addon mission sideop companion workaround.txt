Building Sideops Companion sidops for freeroam addon missions that support quests:
Set up a sideop, giving proper positions in the map, ditto the icon pos.
Set:
Quest Map to Afgh
Quest Area to whatever the top one is.
Quest CP: to anything but NONE
Do all the rest normaly, hit build.
Open SOC folder \Sideop_Build\GameDir\mod\quests\ <questInfo> lua
Change locationId to whatever matches the location:
	look in mgs_tpp\mod\locations at the locationInfo lua for the locationId
	or the more friendlier TppDefine.LOCATION_ID.<locationName> ex. TppDefine.LOCATION_ID.GNTN
Change areaName to an area defined in the locationInfo questAreas
in this case areaName = "gntn",

Example sideop so you can see the questInfo directly (after installing it, see in mod\quests), or just unzip the .mgsv)
