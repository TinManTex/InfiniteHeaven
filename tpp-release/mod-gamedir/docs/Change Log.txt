Infinite Heaven changelog

r248 - 2021-04-08
Version bump and IHHook ver

r247 - 2021-04-05
Cam - Player Cam hook menu
Uses IHHook to adjust the player camera focal length.
Same method as the 'FOV Modifier' (on nexus)
https://github.com/mon/MGSV-TPP-FoV
This IH feature now superscedes that mod, so if IHHook is working (currently requires 1.0.15.3 eng exe) you should remove that mods d3d11.dll

camhook_enable -Enable Player Cam hook,
Only updates after changing cam mode.
	Focal lengths between modes not equivalent (some other factor being applied)
	Lower focal length = wider FOV,
	Higher focal length = lower FOV
camhook_focalLength_NORMAL="FocalLength Normal",
camhook_focalLength_AIMING="FocalLength Aiming",
camhook_focalLength_HIDING="FocalLength Hiding",
camhook_focalLength_CQC="FocalLength CQC",
camhook_ApplyFOV - "Apply FOV" - "Applies FOV(degrees) proportionally to the different cam mode focal lengths."

Camera menu (FreeCam)
Renamed "Cam - AroundCam menu"
Added the other AroundCam settings that could only be changed via the button shortcuts while cam was active.
Added some more of the AroundCam settings
targetInterpTime
rotationLimitMinX
rotationLimitMaxX
alphaDistance
All aroundcam settings now save.

PlayCam menu 
Renamed "Cam - PlayCam menu"
moved to root menu.

Debug Menu: Added manualsequence from devinacc menu.

InfMenu: Break out DisplayCurrentMenu so Ivar commands that change ivars in their menu can refresh it.

Ivars refactor: completed more of the shift of using .settings directly instead of .range to guard the bounds. 
As well as IvarProc.SetSettings to rebuild the .enum, 
and ivar. Init called on all ivars during postallmodulesload to set those ivars that use tables in other modules as settings.

Fix: fix GenerateEvent event not being reapplied on new session when using forceEvent/Trigger IH Event
Fix: MB wargames events not applying soldier body type (would stay as whatever dd suit setting you had) - thanks KLOC for the report and troubleshooting files to test.


r246 - 2021-04-01
Fix: Hang on mission load - just a dumb typo I forgot to error check. 

r245 - 2021-04-01
Fix: Location addon that adds new questarea while not having any sideops installed set in the area would cause the sideops system to break - thanks Delta 6, Yooungi, caplag for the reports

r244 - 2021-03-31 
Fix: Intel team not marking anything on idroid map - AddGlobalLocationParameters modifies by param not by return.

r243 - 2021-03-29
Fix: unlockSideopNumber - 'Unlock specific sideop' not allowing the top most sideop. Had recently cleaned up how some settings ranges were set but forgot that sideops was outside of the normal indexedfrom0 case - thanks psavi for the report (and some others I might have passed by in the past sorry).

unlockSideopNumber now shows the questName.

quietRadioMode - 'Quiets MB radio track' now lists the track names.

weather_requestTag - Weather Menu > RequestTag
A collection of sky, lighting settings bundled under a 'tag' name in the locations weatherParameters file.
[youtube]dgz7vyh_3rQ[/youtube]
https://youtu.be/dgz7vyh_3rQ

SetSkyParameters - Weather Menu > various settings:
weather_skyParameterSetSkyScale="Scale of main clouds overhead",
weather_skyParameterAddOffsetY="Height of horizon clouds",
weather_skyParameterSetScrollSpeedRate="Scrolling speed of horizon clouds",

Mission Addon system:
Initial implementation of sideop support.
[youtube]rBSvPVxLSbc[/youtube]
https://youtu.be/rBSvPVxLSbc

locationInfo .questAreas via InfQuest.AddLocationQuestAreas

missionInfo .globalLocationMapParams (untested) via 
 \Assets\tpp\pack\mbdvc\mb_dvc_top.fpkd \ mbdvc_map_location_parameter.lua GetGlobalLocationParameter

General api:
PlayerStatusEx - Extended version of PlayerStatus enum 
https://metalgearmodding.fandom.com/wiki/PlayerStatus
- thanks to the herculean research by BigBootyBoss

r242 - 2021-03-27
Fix: changeCpSubType - Random CP subtype erroring.

r241 - 2021-03-27
Fix: Addon missions breaking when IHHook not initialized - thanks Yooungi for the report

Log IHHook ver, or warn.
Write IHHook ver to ih_save .ihhookVer

r240 - 2021-03-26
Fix: Game crashing on startup with enableIHExt.
Was trying to log with announcelog via debugprint, which should have been ok because it had a guard against the announcelog not stood-up crash by checking vars.missionCode not nil. Except it should have been checking missionCode wasnt MAX - 65535 - thanks everyone for the report and Venom Raven for the ih_save and testing.
Fix: Mission-prep features menu repeated entry in player restrictions menu removed (is being auto added via parent tag) - thanks OldBoss for the report.

IMGUI: Default style tweaked.

Mission Addon system: 
Free roam missions now get registered to the free roam tab and not the mission tab.
In theory should support moving from an addon free roam to a mission set in that location and visaversa (via mission leave out of bounds).

requestTppBuddy2BlockController var for missionInfo to have TppBuddy2BlockController.CreateBlock and Load called like they would for afgh/mafr. Though inial testing with gntn it doesn't seem to fix selected buddy from mission start not actually enabled issue like I thought it might.

Free roam missions get proper langId for entry thanks to IHHook, uses locationMapParams.locationNameLangId or defaults to tpp_loc_<lowercase locationName>

TppLocation included in IH (can't think of any mods that would mod this so should be a save move).

Refactor: Move InfUtil.GetLocationName into TppLocation to replace.

r239 - 2021-03-24
Update to MGSV version 1.0.15.3

r238 - 2021-03-20
Update to MGSV version 1.0.15.2

Includes IHHook, dll proxy for extending IHs capabilities (similar concept to SKSE), and providing a dear-Imgui version of IH menu (to supersede IHExt).
See IHHook-Changelog.txt or github.com/TinManTex/IHHook

Added: Appearance menu - skipDevelopChecks - Allows items that haven't been developed to be selected in the Appearance menu.
Added: attackHeliType - UTH Blackfoot - thanks caplag for discovering uth TppHeliParameters applied to TppEnemyHeli 
Known Issues: UTH wont attack with missiles despite doing the long on sound and behaviour. UTH attack heli classes not actually visually different.
[youtube]4V7lPJ2t_rw[/youtube]
https://youtu.be/4V7lPJ2t_rw

Added: GeneralHelpItem - mostly for seeing the extensive help text when show help is on.

Added: menu_disableToggleMenuHold - Disable hold menu toggle - Disables the legacy one-button <dive> hold-to-toggle menu, the two button menu combo <zoom_change> + <dash> will still work.

Camera menu:
Added: 'Reset camera position to player' (still can be accessed by pressing the ih camera reset button (binoc) and <dash>) - thanks Muffins for the suggestion (of an obvious oversight).
Added: positionXFreeCam (and Y,Z) - more useful since you can enter the value directly with IHH menu, useful if you have some position from somewhere but you don't know where it is in game.

Ivars / options:
enableHelp renamed menu_enableHelp - to get the new default of on to stick.
disableSelectVehicle, disableSelectTime, disableSelectBuddy changed to per mission type heliSpace_ flags:

Mission prep features override:
Replaces the "Mission-prep restrictions menu"

heliSpace_SkipMissionPreparetion="Skip mission prep"
heliSpace_NoBuddyMenuFromMissionPreparetion="Disable select-buddy"
heliSpace_NoVehicleMenuFromMissionPreparetion="Disable select-vehicle"
heliSpace_DisableSelectSortieTimeFromMissionPreparetion="Disable select-sortie time"

Lets you force on or off the various mission prep features, though some may not make sense or have stuff overidden by the mission, such as enabling mission prep for the prologue.

InfMotion / Motions menu: motionCloseMenuOnPlay - Close menu on Playing motion, defaults to off - thanks choc for bringing it up.

Filestructure: ih_additional_motion.fpk moved from pack/mission2 to the more appropriate pack/player/motion.

mod\devmodules - a collection of IH dev modules created to help with specific aspects of modding.

docs\Development.txt - a couple of modding links, also mentioning the above.

InfWeaponIdTable
Addon system to add weaponIdTable that enemy soldiers equip from.
Selected via weaponTableGlobal<MissionMode> - Global soldier weapon table in FreeRoam/Missions/MB 
via the Custom soldier equip menu.
Example addon in mod\devmodules\weaponIdTables
The existing 'Enemy use custom weapon table' feature uses the selected table to combine from.

Internal and api changes:
startOnFoot support for custom free missions.
MissionCheckFree expanded to custom missions.
weaponIdTable support for custom missions via missionInfo
heliSpaceFlags support for custom missions via missionInfo - thanks caplag for suggestion

OnRestoreSvars called on IH Modules.

Refactor: core scripts to Assets//ih, using LoadLibrary external fallback loading.
LoadExternalModule internal loading support.

InfCore.GetGamePath: 
Use IHHook GetGamePath if available.
Fall back to default steam path if package.path fails.

Refactor: My messy dev stuff - debugshiz and devmenu pushed into IHDebugVars module

Fix: getBodyInfo reverted to directly reading ivar, should fix some issues related to enemy customBodyType - thank Solidus Snake for the report
Fix: GetGroundStartPosition - guard against unexpected mbLayoutCode (still no idea of the situation that would cause the value) - thank Solidus Snake for the files (and caplag for getting him to enable logging)
Fix: error on session change when IHH starts IHext
Fix: All customWeaponTable vars off would error.
Fix: (of a previous fix) of wildcard soldiers causing the game to hang with some sideops,  thanks worthless person for the report.
Fix: GetLastUserMarkerIndex - sometimes would not return correct marker, affected IH features using user markers.
Fix: IHExt shouldn't start with IHHook - thanks Zacc for the report.

r237 - 2020-03-31
Fix: Game % completion was lower than it should have been, and task completion in ui was showing a higher value than max.
See: PATCHUP: BADDATA in InfMission, gvars.ui_isTaskLastComleted
This was due to me messing up the indexing when clearing some of the empty mission slots to use in the IH mission addon system, and a fox engine quirk where setting the save var (TppScriptVar) of TYPE_BOOL to 0 would set it to true.
Caveat: Some users games that were saved prior to r234 might have some tasks marked as completed even if they hadn't done them yet.
Thanks nishi980 for the report.

Fix: My build process was including some files from a snakebite install run, hard to say what if any issues this caused beyond a bigger install size - thanks caplag for the report.

Debug: InfCore.RefreshFileList outputs to cmd_stderr.txt

Fix: The automatic menu close on IH reloadscripts was called at a bad time casing it to  ihsave after Ivars had been reloaded but before it had been stood up in postallmodules (more specficially the ivars in modules loaded after InfMenu). Then if user reloadscript again without ihsaving the save file would effectively been cleared for those it could not find definitions for. 

Fix: r237b - missed " before stderr filename, causing refreshfilelist to fail - thanks morbidslinky for the fix

r236 - 2010-03-18
Fix: InfExtToMgsv mgsvToExtComplete not being set leasing ih_toextcmds.txt to always write all commands, which eventually IHExt would get fed up with. Was somehow lost in some refactoring. Thanks OldBoss for the report.

r235 - 2020-03-15
gameOverOnDiscovery/ now works in free roam.
gameOverOnDiscovery added to playerRestrictionsInMissionMenu
playerRestrictionsInMissionMenu added (actually renamed back to it's actual name and markersInMissionMenu split off). Thanks Steve Harvery for the prompt.

Fix: UAVs on FOB should show their correct grade.
Bug was due from me missing a subltle change while merging the mgsv 1.09 patch in April 2016, ouch.
It got lost in the noise of variable name changes due to the minified lua files. Thanks elquinto for the belated report.

InfUserMarker.PrintMarkerGameObject
Fix: PrintMarkerGameObject sol svars print.
Added: Prints GetPosition of object.

r234 - 2020-02-10
Refactor: Data: Build veh_rl_*_ih packs based on the veh_rl_ packs, removed modded veh_rl fox2s, which suould free up mods for the player vehicles without conflicting with that.
IH modified the player / veh_rl vehicle packs for it's free roam vehicle patrol option.

1. Because the packs were nice complete packs for vehicles, which was important in the early days when I didn't have the knowledge or tooling to create my own fpks.

2. To bump up the instance count for TppVehicle2BodyData and TppVehicle2AttachmentData because I hit the issue of them using up the instances resulting in sideops vehicles appearing invisible.

Though I still don't understand the logic on that since I can have more vehicles than instances in the patrols and they'll still show, but the sideops, which aren't even using the patrol vehicle packs will be affected.

In some ways it's similar to the useextendfova problem wildcards have with sideops.

Thanks placeholderthesteam for the prompt.

InfDemo,InfMenu,InfMenuDefs,InfQuickMenuDefs:
Added: In-Cutscene IH menu can be opened while cutscene playing.
Fixed: Quick menu not working while in cutscenes.
Change: Pause cutscene bind changed from EVADE (dive button) to STANCE (crouch button)

InfNPC:
Change: Additional NPCs changed to a sub menu where you can individually set which additional npcs you want to appear - thanks Muffins for the suggestion.

Fix: Completion percentage dropping to 99% and completed tasks counting higher than max - thanks AsiaSkyly and badbard99 for the reports.

Fix: MB staff died message should appear in Mission 43 - thanks GrimreaperIII3 for the report.
Was being overzealous in TppHero.SetAndAnnounceHeroicOgrePoint, still may need attention.
Also a longstanding errant character I added (the curse of binding an easily pressed mouse button to a keyboard character) in s10240_sequence Damage message may have been causing an issue.

Fix: Wildcard Soldiers causing some sideops to have missing enemies or soldiers and a resulting infinite load on reload or exit free roam.
This seems to be a very long standing bug that I wasn't able to reproduce till recently.
Unfortunately the fix comes at a cost of removing female soldiers from the wildcard feature as the bug is due to some fundamental problem with using the extend part system they use for their models in combination with sideops which was never used in the base game. 
Thanks TheIronIris for providing save files and information so I could reproduce the issue.

Shifted the IH sideops (mother base animals and Blackfoot down) out of IH installation to their own addon mod. This stays truer to IH's 'default by default' policy and helps the sideops count now that the community has made many sideops.

headInfo addons (fovaInfo):
Added overwriteFaceId
Added uiTextureName
Allows addon creators to overwrite the games existing head definitions for MB Staff.
See the notes in mod\core\InfModelProc.lua for more info.

Thanks Cuba for his mod pushing in this direction to prompt me to add the feature.

IH Core:
InfMain.UpdateBegin for a Update before any other modules (base game Updates are after, and InfMain.Update was last).
module .Update functions now get the missionTable param.

Implementation of IHHook features (if installed):
Call to IHH.Init from init.lua
Call to IHH.OnUpdate from TppMain (actually from InfMain.UpdateBegin)

Communication between IH and IHExt using named pipe for better performance when using the IHExt menu.

Logging (mostly used for debugging) through IHH for better performance.

r233 - 2019-11-27
Version bump for MGSV version 1.0.15.1
There was no actual script changes in the last MGSV update (nor this one) that made this necesary, but it slipped by when I got busy.

Fix: Running prologue with debug mode on would cause weirdness. (10010 OnRestoreSVars has a yeild so PCalling it would error-skip the function).
InfCore.Validate: Clarified error message, does not bail on first fail so all failures can be logged.
InfUtil.InsertUniqueInList: Because sometimes you just gotta.
InfMission: small refactor
InfMission: fleshed out a lot more missing missionInfo/mission addon stuff: 
TppEneFova.fovaSetupFuncs, TppResult.MISSION_GUARANTEE_GMP, TppResult.MISSION_TASK_LIST, TppEneFova.noArmorForMission, 
TppEneFova.missionArmorType, TppEneFova.missionHostageInfos, NO_ORDER_BOX_MISSION,
<free roam mission>_sequence.missionStartPosition.orderBoxList, <free roam mission>_orderBoxList
InfMission: missionInfo module support enabling hot zones (which is really just to bypass my disable OOB hack).
Thanks caplag for pointing to some of these with his addon mission.
See InfMission for example of the mission addon module.

r232 - 2018-08-01
Fixed: 'DD Suit female' settings showing as 'table'

Refactor: customSoldierType - keys off igvars bodyType and bodyTypeExtend on PreMissionLoad instead of always off ivar. Provides some leeway in handling outcomes from body addons.

r231 - 2018-07-28
InfRoutes - Counterpart to InfPositions, InfObjects as a load/save list of routes used for some debug options.

InfNPCHeli
Custom heli patrol routes 
heli_patrol_routes_afgh.fpk - heli_patrol_routes_afgh.frt, and mafr counterpart. 
Just based of the drp routes I was using but with edges sanded off and sendmessage at and route.
Route change is now msg based and now that distance to troublesome parts of the route are no longer an issue the update loop can be ditched (but still currently used for mtbs for changing route periodically).
TppEnemy.StoreSVars/RestoreOnContinueFromCheckPoint2 reverted to saving heli svars, heli state should now, the previous bug that this was a workaround for is mysteriously absent, possibly due to the fact I'm not forcing route on continue.

Fixed: InfMenu.PostModuleReload MenuOff moved to PreModuleReload, the save triggered by the normal menu off process would run into strife as Ivars had been cleared and the rest of the modules hadn't reloaded yet to add them back.

InfModelProc: Soldier2FaceAndBodyData calls into this for body fova additions like it does face fova.

Removed Setting: staff 'DD Suit' - 'Fatigues - All' setting to relieve additional fv2 limit for future addons. Won't return till/if full FoxKit gets full fv2 support.

Framework: Soldier body fv2/fovaInfo addon support from \mod\fovaInfo via InfModelProc (bad name) to Soldier2FaceAndBodyInfo, have had face fovaInfo support for a long time, this just extends to body fovaInfo.
Framework: WIP Soldier bodyInfo support from \mod\bodyInfo via InfBodyInfo to customSoldierType ivar(s). Still needs system to handle outcomes from uninstalled addons.

Added Settings: Ocelot and Quiet added to Appearance > Player Type - WARNING: Ocelot and Quiet player types have side effect when used due to trying to work around them being restricted to FOB. The Pause menu will be disabled and the game may hit an infinite load if you complete a mission while they are used. Use nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/518 by BobDoleOwndU to fix sound issues with using these player types.

Updated to TPP 1.0.13

r230 - 2018-05-08
Fixed: IHExtToMgsv.ProcessCommands calling WriteToExtTxt every frame, seems like this bug may have been in there since wpf IHExts creation.
Fixed: IHExtToMgsv.ProcessCommands Not converting mgsvToExtComplete arg to number. Though the WriteToExtTxt concat seemed to interpret ok anyway?
Fixed: IHExtToMgsv.ProcessCommands no longer polls ih_tomgsvcmds.txt unless menu is open. This does mean no independant commands from IHExt, but apart from sessionchange, and togglemenu there werent any anyway.
This should hopefully reduce the cases of lag on systems that are sensitive to how IH handles i/o - thanks to darkallnight for the reports and files to test with.
Logging: Changed some LogFlow calls to Log for startup
Logging: lua memory usage 
Sys: running garbagecollect at end of start and LoadExternalModules. Can only assume the engine is doing some kind of lua management. hopefully this wont interfere.
Refactor: IvarProc.BuildSaveText and other aspects of IH save to decrease save time.
Fixed: Shifted various list based Ivars to index from 0 so IHExt combobox is not off-by-one.
IvarProc: Vector3Ivar and other supporting functions to manage vector4 as ivar.

InfObjects: Counterpart to InfPositions but for game object names, prior InfLookup.GetObjectList commands now use this.
Objects menu
Counterpart to Positions menu, for adding to, saving/loading a game object name list. The list is used for other commands/features like warp, PlayCam target.

ih_save: IvarProc.BuildSaveText now only writes if there's been a change. Should likewise help the i/o sensitive systems.

InfPlayCam
PlayCam: Alternative camera to Free cam - thanks choc for prompting me to look at it.
(via Camera menu > PlayCam menu)

https://youtu.be/CQKOO-jnkBI

r229 - 2018-04-21
Fixed: Removal of some not-actually-subp subps from buildtool being too enthusiastic.
Fixed: ShowFreeCamPosition not working.
Fixed: Add position to position list not adding free cam position when in free cam.
Fixed: Menu could be activated during loadscreen.
Fixed: InfMenuCommands.ToggleFreeCam > InfCamera.ToggleFreeCam for SOC quickmenu.
Fixed: Warp mode not working and also breaking IH menu - thanks everyone for the reports.
TppEnemy: WIP quest support for hostage route, has issue where it wont work when reactivating quest though (leaving quest area and returning).
TppEnemy: WIP quest support for uav setup, has crashing issue, either hitting the usual combined resources issue or it's not happy with being loaded/reloaded at runtime. uav fpk not yet in release build.

r228 - 2018-04-16
Fixed: IH buttons/menu responsiveness when using HighSpeedCam/TimeScaleMode - InfButtons/InfMenu using os.clock instead of Time.GetRawElapsed (which is synced to game timescale) - thanks VenomHSCV for the prod.
InfWeather:
Option: weather_forceType - Force weather
Option: weather_fogDensity - Fog density
Option: weather_fogType - Fog type
(via In-mission > Weather menu)

Option: clock_setTime - Set clock time
(via In-Mission > Time scale menu)

QuickMenu: Reverted button back to <Call>

r227 - 2018-04-04
Fixed: Prior style QuickMenus breaking in various ways (SOC quickmenu for example).
Refactor: No longer calling WriteToExtTxt() every ExtCmd, should smooth IHExt performance a bit.
IHExt: Better handling of selecting menuLine text when giving focus via mouse click.

r226 - 2018-04-03
Changes to buttons/keys:
InfMenu: While menu open hold <Switch Zoom> (V key or RStick click) + player move (WSAD or left stick) to navigate menu
Quick menu: No longer uses <Call>, now activated with <Switch Zoom> (V key or RStick click) + command key (see MGS_TPP\mod\modules\InfQuickMenuDefs.lua)

ChangeLog: merged some older seperate modfpk/data changelogs.

Refactor: OnChange self,setting,previousSetting swapped to self,setting,previousSetting.
Refactor: InfMenu lang stuff moved to InfLangProc.
Refactor: InfMenu, InfLZ, InfRevenge to external.
Refactor: execChecks.inHelispace renamed inSafeSpace, missioncode check function added
Refactor: InfMenuDefs.heliSpaceMenu renamed safeSpaceMenu
Refactor: Remaining Tpp requires modules InfButton, InfModules, InfMain moved to external / core
Refactor: InfInitMain to load and Exec prior Tpp requires modules and kick off LoadExternalModules
InfCore: LoadLibrary: Wrapped lua chunk load in PCall to catch errors (was only catching LoadFile)

WIP: sys_increaseMemoryAlloc - increases various memory allocation sizes, to no noticable effect on stability -_-
WIP: quest_useAltForceFulton - fires CheckDeactiveQuestAreaForceFulton when outside quest activeArea instead of by traps, needs testing as posibly the trap method was added because of issues with what this is attempting.

Fixed: IHExt InfMenu.GetSetting GetSettingText out of bounds. Affected buddyChangeEquipVar, possibly a couple other menu items - thanks WyteKnight for the report.
Fixed: QuietMoveToLastMarker not working, hadn't transfered a localopt of SendCommand  - thanks WyteKnight for the report.
Fixed: DropCurrentEquip not working, issue as above - thanks Saladin1251 for the report.
Fixed: Changing 'Player life scale' in-mission not working - thanks Ronix0 for the report.
Fixed: Zombie Obliteration hang on load, hadn't added localopts when moving SetUpMBZombie from InfMain - thanks magicc4ke for the report.
Fixed: IHExt - not displaying current setting upon activating an option from IHExt.

IHExt: MenuLine changed from Label to TextBox, GotKeyboardFocus, EnterText commands.
IHExt: Search (EnterText > InfMenu.BuildMenuDefForSearch). Alt-tab to IHExt, click or tab the text of the menu line below the menu list. Type something and press Enter.

r225 - 2018-03-07
Fixed: Hang on load with no ih_save, wasn't initializing igvars oops - thanks серёжа for the report and the save files to test.

r224 - 2018-03-06
IHExt: args[1] - gameProcessName

Refactor: InfMain.LoadLibraries > module.LoadLibraries
Refactor: Ivars split into modules that have the main use/implmentation of the Ivar (or even <module>Ivars when that gets too hefty).
Refactor: InfMenuDefs split into modules.
Refactor: InfLang split into modules.
Refactor: IvarProc missionModeIvars split to missionModeIvarsNames (string) so ih modules can support. fixup of string table to ivar table done at postmodulesload
Refactor: InfFova moved from libs to external.
Refactor: InfMain split to InfMainTpp, InfTimeScale, external. Probably needs more splitting.
Refactor: TppDbgStr32 methods/lookup table migrated into InfLookup. mod/strings/ > Str32 lookup now on InfLookup.PostAllModulesLoad instead of OnInitializeTop which should help mission loading time with debug mode on a bit.
TppDbgStr32 reverted to vanilla/no longer included in build.

InfMotion:
Motions menu - Play different animations on player. A motion group may contain several related animations (usually lead-in, idle, lead-out)
Option: Motion group - Press <Action> to play the selected animation.
Option: Motion number - Press <Action> to play the selected animation.
Option: Hold motion - Holds motion, requires stop motion to stop.
Option: Repeat motion - Repeat motion at end, some animations don't support this.
Option: Stop motion - Use to stop motions with motion hold or motion repeat.
Option: Play motion - Closes menu and plays current selected motion.
(via in-mission menu)

InfPosition:
Positions list from ShowPosition migrated to it's own command, commands for adding user markers, clearing, and writing them to \mgsv_tpp\mod\ added
Positions menu - for writing in game postitions to files, useful for getting positions when creating sideops.
Commands:
Add current position to Positions List - Add current player or freecam position to Positions List, positions list can be written to file with Write Positons List command.
Add markers to Positions List - Adds current user markers to positions list, positions list can be written to file with Write Positons List command.
Write Positions List - Writes Positions List to files in MGS_TPP\mod\
Clear Positions List - Clears Positions List
(via in-mission menu)

Data: Walker instance count dropped from 16 to 14 - 10x for IH and 4x for quest. Should ease the gameobject limit/issue a little bit too.
Workaround: Walker positions in free roam now static / using locator positions. Setposition breaks when other locators are loaded in sideop. This workaround doesnt really work for motherbase since it has the further requirements of only having walkers on platforms that are actually built (and I'm not about to make 7x10 variations).

Command: Support heli to marker - Sends Support heli to Landing Zone closest to the last placed user marker while riding it. This replaces the existing 'Support heli to latest marker' and now can only be used while riding the support heli. This removes a lot of the issues of riding the support heli across the map that the prior method had.
Implmentation wise this works by forcing the heli to a specific route, the WIP version prior to this had too many issues since it used LZ routes, now it uses custom routes thanks to sais FoxLib. So special thanks for his work on the library.
(via in-mission menu)

r223 - 2017-10-02
Fixed: IHExt help box appearing on map change - thanks vollmerej1 for the report.
Fixed: ih_tomgsvcmds being read every frame, causing stutter on some systems. Lua io has a bigger overhead than I thought - thanks BurkusCat for his data, others for their reports. 

r222 - 2017-09-19
IHExt: Included in build - thanks MorbidSlinky for the SnakeBite update.

Fixed: Custom sideops with helis not allocating a heli (if no normal heli sidops also active) - Adding hasEnemyHeli to quest definition will add it to the heli quest list - which means force heli reinforce will also block those quests - thanks MorbidSlinky for the report.

Fixed: StartIHExt with paths with spaces in them - thanks GambChon for the report.

r221 - 2017-09-17
Fixed: IHExt setting when IHExt is not installed.

IHExt: added helptext, menutitle, combobox for settings.

r220 - 2017-09-11
Addition: Added 'Enemy prep' setting to Attack heli patrols options - sets the number of helis to scale with enemy prep level.

Fixed: Hang on load when ih_save contains an unknown variable (most recently caused by my rename of heliPatrols ivars) - an access to the ivar slipped outside of my check to see if the ivar actually existed. - thanks ashy8000 for the save files and others for the reports.

Fixed: Re-added <Action> tag to options that have OnActivate, was a bit too zealous in removing it. 

InfButton: some localopts, adjustments for repeat speed with IHExt.

Debugging: InfCore.PCall force logs error.

IHExt: Output menu to list.

r219 - 2017-09-03
(Actually added in r218, but not in easily accessable menu)
Options: setStageBlockPositionToMarkerClosest, setStageBlockPositionToFreeCam, resetStageBlockPosition - sets stageblock loading position. You have to put player in a safe spot/bump player health to 650% so they dont die when their current position unloads and they (may) fall through terrain till they hit level floor.
(via in mission debug menu)

Fixed: Lag or load hangs due to a file that was removed for r218 that may have been left in MGS_TPP\mod\modules if mod user didn't uninstall r217 or earlier correctly using snakebite.
Detail: Added empty function InfCore.DoToMgsvCommands which InfProcessExt calls. Would not have been an issue except I also removed the ivar that would exit before the call and the check for it was ==0, a not ivar would have covered the ivar being null too and prevented the issue (though I would not have been aware of the file lingering for some users).

Modules: Support for Ivar and menu definitions in IH modules.

r218 - 2017-08-31
heliPatrolsMB, heliPatrolsFREE renamed attackHeliPatrolsFREE, attackHeliPatrolsFREE "Attack heli patrols in free roam",
  "Attack heli patrols in MB", value is now number of attack helis.
Option: supportHeliPatrolsMB - split from heliPatrolsMB, is number of support npc helis, count will take priority over attack helis to fit to number of mother base clusters built.
Beyond giving some more control over amount of helis you face, it also lets things be a bit quieter in mother base while still having helis fly around. 
Because of this change you will have to set the options again, sorry for the inconvenience.

Refactor: InfMenuDefs,InfQuickMenuDefs commands change to string/lazy binding. Some commands that were just wrappers to other modules reference them directly.
InfQuickMenuCommands: Merged with InfMenuCommands

Fixed: ApplyProfile failing on random table of setting strings. 
Fixed: ApplyProfile failing on missing ivar.

IHExt: Shift from console to wpf proto branch.

Option: enableIHExt (was postExtCommands) 'Enable IHExt', now launches IHExt (if present).


r217 - 2017-08-22

r216 - 2017-08-22
GameEvent: Other swimsuits added to Femme Fatales event.
Fixed: Random roam event selection failing.
InfCore: path serperators changed to forwardslash.

InfLookup: subtitleId32ToString now uses supb_dictionary
Mock: More yeilding to host during load. 

Options: mbShowHuey - Show Huey - Shows Huey in BattleGear hangar and in cutscenes even before he's arrived or after he's left story-wise.

(via Mother Base > Show assets menu)

Options: MB Ocean options - adjust various parameters of ocean movement.
(via MB Ocean menu while in mother base)

Fixed: removed \mod from package.path which caused users who had old IH pre-mod folder restructure installs to fail on load (and one cause of 'Could not load modules from MGS_TPP\').
Should have done this when I did the restucture.

r215 - 2017-08-13
Fixed: Hang on load, due to a ghost of an old file or something. Sorry.

r214 - 2017-08-13
Fixed: ih_priority_staff sometimes clearing saved data

BuildTool: Copy docs to makebite\GameDir
InfAutoDoc: Now writes All options profile to release - thanks pk5547 for the report.
Now that these are automated should stop me from ocasionally forgetting to include the current ones when building release lol.

r213 - 2017-08-09
Fixed: playerPartsType/'Suit type' syntax error causing it to be missing from menu - thanks SoullessMadness for the report
Fixed: Heavy Armor in free roam option being missing from menu, and the knock on effect of the rest of the menu options being missing from Features and Options document and All options profile. Thanks Nano-Ocelot, pk5547 for the reports.

Option: enableEventHUNTED - "Allow Hunted event"
Option: enableEventCRASHLAND - "Allow Crashland event"

Command: "Add player staff to MB priority"
Command: "Remove player staff to MB priority"
Command: "Add marked staff id MB priority"
Command: "Remove marked staff to MB priority"
Command: "Clear MB staff priority list"
(via Mother base > Staff menu)

Using these commands you can either add the current chosen staff member, or a staff member that you've marked to the priority list. Upon visiting mother base these members will be chosen to be on base (assuming they are not on deploy mission).

Menu: Staff menu, apart from the above, mbPrioritizeFemale,mbMoraleBoosts have been moved here.

Option: mbEnableMissionPrep - "Enable mission prep to MB" - may require an exit/return from ACC to take effect.
(via Mission-prep restrictions menu)

More mockfox stuff.

r212 - 2017-08-03
Fixed: Primary/Secondary NONE slots conflicting with swimsuit dev entries.
Fixed: Camo type appearance menu option erroring when no developed camos for current suit.
Fixed: playerPartsType/'Suit type' now sets playerCamoType on change.

Addition: 1.0.11 Swimsuits added to customSoldierType (free,DD Suit)

r211 - 2017-08-02
Updated for mgstpp 1.0.11.0

Added: itemLevelIntScope - Int-Scope level, itemLevelIDroid - Int-Scope level. Lets you set the item grade - thanks Saladin1251 for the suggestion. 
(via Player restrictions > Item level menu)

Fixed: Invisible tanks in Afghanistan freeroam sideops with vehicle patrols on. Misspelled veh_rl_east_tnk_fpkd as veh_rl_east_tank_fpkd when I renamed them back in r196 due to snakebite dictionary update. Oops - thanks pk5547 for save data and report.

Commands: setSelectedObjectToMarkerClosest, setSelectedCpToMarkerClosestCp - debug shiz.

Addition: 1.0.11 Swimsuits added to appearance menu.

r210 - 2017-07-22
Fixed: Quarantine platform soldiers having no weapons with custom equip table.
Fixed: mbNpcRouteChange - 'Soldiers move between platforms' not working on initial cluster load, looks like I broke it in r208 - thanks pk5547 for save data, others for the report.
Fixed: Additional npcs with no faces on quarantine and Skulls T-Posing, just disabling additional npcs on quarantine completely at the moment - thanks pk5547 for save data and report.
Fixed: InfEquip.DropItem on GetPosition nil (Eli)
Fixed: postExtCommands not passing currentSetting to OnSelect (unlockSideOpNumber)

Mock: Various settings to manage the distinction between host types.

r209 - 2017-07-17
Debug: loadToACC settable on ih_save to have game load ACC on continue from title menu instead of loading saved mission. 
Is same as holding Escape for a couple of seconds at tile, but possibly more discoverable or providable.

AutoDoc/WriteProfile: IsForProfile now excludes non save ivars.

Mock: Bunch of work on Mock pulling from Dump.

Fixed: Skulls event being forced to Sniper skulls, forgot to revert my debug test which means:
Fixed: (refixed) Crash on encounter with Quiet in free roam when Parasite event selects Camo skulls.
Should actually be fixed now. Sorry.

Fixed: Accidentally left out the IH mother base animal sideops, Blackfoot Down in r208. Woops.

IvarProc.LoadEvars loads ih_save.lua to global module (instead of just to a local and operating/discarding that), InfQuest.ReadQuestStates reads from that instead of loading ih_save.lua

Refactor: Equipment loading centralized in InfEquip.LoadEquipTable, CreateCustomWeaponTable now takes that loaded equip into account for equipment limit.
Fixed: Not being able to use weapons/weapon ammo count wrong with custom soldier equipment and other settings on alongside sideops mod. Thanks various people for reports.

ih_save will retain addon sideops states even when game run with addon sideops not installed.

r208 - 2017-05-30
Option: loadAddonMission - "Load addon mission" - WIP
(via IH system menu)

Fixed: Sideop list not showing sideops > 192. This is a hard limit in the ui, this workaround manages by skipping random cleared but not currently active sideops. Reroll sideops selection will also reroll this selection.
Ref InfQuest.GetSideOpsListTable

Option: showAllOpenSideopsOnUi "Show all open sideops" - "Shows all open sideops in sideop list, this mostly affects open but not yet completed sideops from hiding others. There is however a limit of 192 entries for the sideop list, so some will be randomly dropped from the list."
(via Sideops menu)

Fixed: mbAdditionalNPCS KLUDGE DDs groundcrew on Zoo 

Fixed: Female soldiers defaulting to male olive drab body when DD suit female set to Off instead of olive drab female while DD Suit for male not Off - thanks Saladin1251 for the report and save files.
Fixed: Invisible helmets for female wildcard soldiers (removed helmet propety alltogether) - thanks halo4kid for the report.

Refactor: InfCore.RefreshFileList parse a single dir > ih_files.txt instead of one per subfolder.

Option: ihMissionsPercentageCount - "Include addon missions in completion percentage" 
(via IH system menu)

Fixed: (refixed) Crash on encounter with Quiet in free roam when Parasite event selects Camo skulls. Thanks AyyKyu for the report and files.

Updated: showPosition - now adjusted by -0.8 for a more accurate ground position
Updated: showPosition - writes rotationsXML / quaternion of current playerY

Option: speedCamNoDustEffect - "No screen effect" - "Does not apply the dust and blur effect while TSM is active."
(via Time scale menu)

Data: location\ombs\ombs.fpk/d - adapted from mbqf
Data: location\ombs\pack_common\ombs_common.fpk/d adaptped from mbqf_common/ gz ombs_common
See wip\old mother base for just gz ombs ombs_common.
Data: location\ombs\pack_small\*.fpk/d adapted from location/mbqf

Data: mission2\free\f30045\f30045.fpk/d based on f30050_hanger_btg05.fpk/d
Data: ftsb for ombs modified from mbqf ftsb to point to ombs pack_common

Module: InfMission - to patch in various location and mission info.

MGO maps: remove MGO only entities from pack_common fpkds.

r207 - 2017-05-10

Addition: Addon sideop on Sideop selection mode to filter for additional sideops.

InfCore: gameIdToName,GetGameObjectId. For lookups.

Fixed: 'Fatigues All' Custom soldier type/DD suit hanging on load.

InfMain.OnAllocate: bumped equip block size and max pickable count.
Fixed: Equipment on trucks equipment not appearing with some other settings. Afghanistan range of equipment less than Africa.
InfQuest: requestEquipIds > RequestLoadToEquipMissionBlock for sideops with pickables.

r206 - 2017-05-02

FreeCam: Speed adjust rate change to be slower.

Option: rerollQuestSelection - Reroll quest selection
(via Sideops menu)

Fixed: NPC positions on outer clusters when command cluster is under grad 4/not fully built (currently just disabling NPCs on the outer clusters for that situation).

Fixed: XRay markers. 
No idea how I broke it, or more specifically why it was working when it was called where it was.

Command: selectedChangeWeapon renamed dropTestEquip
Command: dropLoadedEquip pulls from loadEquip table.
Command: selectEvent

Option: hideContainersMB - "Hide containers"
Option: hideAACannonsMB - "Hide AA cannons"
Option: hideAAGatlingsMB - "Hide AA gatlings"
Option: hideTurretMgsMB - "Hide turret machineguns"
(via Mother base > Show Assets menu)
Removing AA guns can be good for wargames if you dont want something that can swiss cheese helis around.
Removing all the AA and the conainers can be useful if you want to drive/gallop around the platforms without so much stuff being in the way.

Fixed: Some custom soldier type/dd suit bodies incorrect.

Debuging: Logging of TpSequence.SetNextSequence
InfHooks: Debughooks also logging function args

InfQuest: Allow quest block script to use external quest definition as its replacement. 
InfQuest: Reworked to allow reloading scripts while in-game.

r205 - 2017-04-29
Addition: DD Suit - Fatigues All - will have random selection from all fatigue camos.

Refactor: Shift from IsFemale cmd (which is actualy only for hostage) to own IsFemale set/get function. Would cause bodyInfo to always default to male causing various issues for dd suit female/female wildcards as they defaulted to male bodyInfo. Still don't have full coverage as selection of faceId is later than many functions that use bodyInfo.
Fixed: various DD suit/wildcard females issues. 

Module: InfMBAssets - implements fulton/ir sensor alarm response.
Option: enableFultonAlarmsMB - "Enable asset alarms" - "Enables anti fulton theft alarms on containers and AA guns. Only partially working, will only trigger alarm once.",
Option: enableIRSensorsMB - "Enable ir sensors" - "Enable ir sensor gates. Only partially working, will only be at level 1 (one beam) and will only trigger alarm once.",
(via Mother base > Show Assets menu)

Data: ih_ships.fpk
Option: mbShowShips - "Show ships" - Shows some ships around mother base.
(via Mother base > Show Assets menu)

InfMain: Refactor - shifting some module specific code to the modules
InfSoldierParams: Made external.

Fixes: Various modules with on cluster load setup when moving to the seperation plat (which won't actually happen outside of warping). Seems like the initial idea might have been to be travel to it without loading a seperate missioncode. One texture in the game (no idea of the name/path) shows a map of

Sideop: Blackfoot down updated. Added soldiers to river LZ (routes from q11050).

Update: Add/subtract demon points decreased to 90k per use - thanks SoullessMadness for the suggestion.
See https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/718564-metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/72466130 for breakdown of the demon points levels.

InfLookup: More message signatures.
InfStrCode: Changed to read .lookupStrings table from any modules. Bunch of string scrapes from exe,fox2,lang dict added to modders resource.

r204 - 2017-04-23
(version skip because of 202a/203 snakebite 0.8.5 .6 ver confusion)

EquipIdTable: Assigned world models to EQP_IT_Stealth,EQP_IT_InstantStealth (reusing idroid model), EQP_IT_ParasiteMist, EQP_IT_ParasiteCamouf, EQP_IT_ParasiteHard, EQP_IT_Pentazemin, EQP_IT_Clairvoyance, EQP_IT_ReflexMedicine (reusing bait model)

Fixed: Multiple female hostage sideops only applying female voice to one hostage. (in TppEnemy.SetupActivateQuestHostage)

InfQuest: Shift questInfo luas to load from external quests folder. 
InfQuest: qst_questClearedFlag now saved directly instead of just the index of.

Data: Shifted soundbank loading files (.sdf,fox2s) from ih_hostage_def.fpkd to ih_hostage_base.

r202 - 2017-04-09
Fixed: Number of helis on < 7 clusters, including mass bunching when only command is built.

Option: ihSideopsPercentageCount - "Include IH sideops in completion percentage." - Additional IH sideops count towards game completion percent - defaults to off.
(via sideops menu)

Refactor: InfModelProc - fovaInfo entries can now be referenced by fv2 filename, allows using existing entries instead of having to add duplicate.
Refactor: InfEneFova - the various head fova infos now referenced by fova name instead of index.
Refactor: Some functions shifted from InfCore to InfUtil, InfUtil loaded earlier during startup.

Refactor: pattern for messages in external modules changed to niling messageExecTable straight off in Init/OnReload and having OnMessage just be a call to Tpp.DoMessage instead of bailing on specific checks. 

Feature: Completed randomFaceListIH for quests, a downside is it doesn't support mixed specific face and random like randomFaceList does - thanks MorbidSlinky for the headsup.

Known Issue: Crash on exit from title after having returned to acc from mb during the game session with mbAdditionalNpcs. Similar issue to r179 which also involved hostage entities (do comp r179 vs r178/f30050_npc.fox2)

Data: ih_hostage_base.fpk/d - based off mis_com_mafr_hostage.fpk, to complement bodyInfo system.

Refactor: InfNPC to InfSoldier
Module: InfNPC - split from InfHostage, handles mbAdditionalNpcs="Additional NPCs",

Option: mbAdditionalNpcs - "Additional NPCs" - Adds different NPCs standing around mother base, including ground crew, researchers and Miller.
(via mother base > Show characters menu)

r201 - 2017-03-30
Fixed: Mother base soldier getting set to hostile - thanks captainking91, others for the reports

revengeModeMB is now revengeModeMB_ALL

Refactor: InfEneFova.ddBodyInfo split to modules\InfBodyInfo.lua .bodyInfo.  

Data: ih_soldier_base.fpk/*_mdl.fpk

Refactor: InfModelProc, now loads all fovaInfo files in mod\fovaInfo 
InfLookup: added (possibly incomplete) gameObjectClass names.

Option: customSoldierTypeFREE - Custom soldier type in Free roam - Override the soldier type of enemy soldiers in Free Roam.
(via Enemy Prep menu)
Added settings for DD suit (same options as Custom soldier type): MSF GZ, XOF Gasmasks, XOF GZ, Genome Soldier. May need to re set your DD suit setting as some existing tiems in list have been shifted.

Refactor: InfEneFova.AddBodyPacks added, ddBody pack setup shifted from TppMissionList to InfNPC, in conjunction with the mission mode ivars for customSoldierType give coverage to any mission.

Refactor: Improved GetHeadGearForPowers selection

r200 - 2017-03-05
Option: forceDemoAllowAction - "Force allow actions" - Prevents disabling of player actions during cutscene, but most cutscenes require the Disable cutscene camera mod on the IH files page.
(via Cutscenes menu)

Feature: Quickmenu binds for when cutscenes running, currently only Free cam useful with above option and Disable cutscene camera mod.

Refactor: Non critical external modules failing to load will no longer block the IH menu from opening - thanks CantStoptheBipBop for the report.
Fixed: Skull attack on quarantine platform failing part way through ParasiteAppear - thanks pk5547 for the report.
Fixed: Cutscene reset.
Fixed: Using mbShowCodeTalker - "Show Code Talker" option on a save before meeting him causing infinite load - thanks junguler for the report.
Fixed: Quick heli pull-out toggle no longer triggers if idroid open.
Fixed: FreeCam code not disabling when changing level.

Refactor: File per profile, list all profiles in profiles folder.
Refactor: Load all external modules load from modules folder/don't have to manually add to InfModules
Refactor: ih_save.lua now in mod\saves

Fixed: Legendary animal sideops not completing on fulton - thanks iponomama for the report.

Fixed: Afghanistan quests with unique bodies (Armor, Wandering MB soldiers) being invisible, was broken since r155 - thanks everyone for the reports.
Detail: ih_soldier_loc_free soldier count dropped from 50 to 40. Don't know why the number of soldiers is breaking the fova system here, quest fova for unique bodies (which is set up on quest block load) breaks, but if you allocate the body in pre mission load it's fine. *shrug*

Fixed: Soldiers having no heads on Mission 43 "Shining Lights Even In Death" - thanks AustrianWarMachine for the report.

r197 - 2017-01-11
Refactor: Rename InfLog to InfCore, .Add to .Log

Refactor: InfInspect loading shifted to init.lua
Refactor: IvarProc,Ivars - dependancies removed

Refactor: InfProc - save system made a little more ameniable to reading/writing other sections.

Build: Included TppVarInit to manually hook StartTitle (as its loaded after requires list/InfHook)

Fix: gameSaveFirstLoad now somewhat accurate (wasn't actually used), and InfMain.OnStartTitle can be used as on-first game save load.

InfQuest: installedQuests management of gvars quest states for IH quest sub-mods. The existing IH quests will be cleared on start of this version but will keep their state as long as the ih_save has the installedQuests added.

Module: InfSecurityCam WIP
Data: ih_security_cam.fpk
Works but crashes on map exit (some times, but consistantly till (sometimes) proper map reset (ie not just abort to acc/start again), assuming its the combined gameobject/allocation issue.

Module: InfUAV WIP
Data: ih_uav.fpk/d
Working, but not useful without custom routes.

Module: InfHostage WIP (acually starteds in prior versions). 
Setting face via uniquesettings doesn't seem to set body skin fova?
SetRelative vehicle requires a route to be set. 
Hostages can't follow travelplans as far as I can tell.
A few attempt to expand quest random face system to more than one face per quest, but the whole thing is super flakey and will more often than not not load the head, including weirdness where it will, then will stop rendering it while in game.

Fixed: Start offline option preventing dlc items - thanks morbidslinky for the fix.

Fixed: Starting on map floor on mother base start on foot on first visit after building a platform in the command cluster - thanks NasaNhak 
(InfMain.OnGameStart)

Refactor: Ivars system,ih_save loaded on init.lua, now (non-gvar) ivars useable from very start of script system execution.

Command: setAllFriendly - In debug stuff menu

Feature: External loading/replacement of most scripts via MGS_TPP\mod\<script path>, more for modder expermentation than average user.

r196 - 2016-12-10
Core: GetPath nil fallback to C:\

Added Headgear (cosmetic) to Filter Faces (splits headgear from Unique filter)

Fixed: Onselect settings param passing through

Build for SnakeBite 0.8.4
Data: veh_rl_* to proper names from hashed.

Fixed: Female Wildcard face range incorrect, resulting in defaulting to smushmanface.

Fixed: Quests with balaclavas breaking those soldiers - thanks shynbean and PerkPrincess for your report.

Fixed: mbAdditionalSoldiers,"More soldiers on MB plats" not loading the additonal soldiers, reulting in empty platforms - thanks  shynbean for the report.

Fixed: IH interrogations would not return wildcard soldier locations - thanks rargh for the report.

Fixed: Soldier headgear on fobs.

r195 - 2016-12-03

Wildcard soldiers and hostages have staff parameters regenerated. Should always have a skill assigned now and have high stats (in respect to current mb level/stats draw)

Refactor: Only call module prereload/postreload on actual user module reload.
PostAllModulesReload renamed PostAllModulesLoad to clarify it's execution.

mbPrioritizeFemale - "Female staff selection" - added Half setting.

Fixed: Crash on startup with missing InfModelRegistry (loadboxed forceing debugprint/anouncelog in start.lua which is aparently too early for announcelog system)

InfEnemyPhase - fixed phasechange update, had found the issue just prior, but thanks GloomMouse for the report anyway.

InfQuest: Added randomFaceList support to registerquests

InfQuest: WIP quest mod support. Split questInfo into seperate modules to allow quest mods. Example quest created, but broke it at some point, and still need documentation, need to get this version out though for some fixes.

Show position command: expanded to logprint large block name, small block index, quest area and isinside areatypes;
command now adds positions to a table and logprints them out, useful for getting a bunch of positions without having to scour the output for them individually (though I should just dump them to a file)

Functionality: Extended TppEneFova PreMissionLoad fova setup to external modules.

Data: ih_quest.<langcode>.lng2 split to ih_general.<langcode>lng2
Module: InfUtil - split some functions from InfMain

Fixed: (partial), setting unlockSideOpNumber via profile will not give OUT OF BOUNDS error, but currently still won't be able to set them > 157 - to new sideops - thanks pk5547 for the report.

Refactor: Shifted IvarProc.OnCreateOrLoadSaveData into LoadEvars, consequently ih_save initial load is earlier, in init mission load.
Need to split from gvars if I want to go earlier.

Data: Split ih_bird_quest.fpk/d into ih_raven.fpk/d
Increased number of ravens to 8.
Sideop: Birds in the belfrey - number of birds increased.
Data: Split ih_rat_quest.fpk/d into ih_rat.fpk/d

Option: mbEnableBirds - "Enable Birds" - enables birds flying around mother base.
(via the Mother base > Show characters menu)

Expanded resource amount scales to scale by type:
enableResourceScale="Enables the resource scale options that scale the amount of resources when gathered (material case resources, containers, diamonds, plants)",
resourceScaleMaterial="Material case scale"
resourceScalePlant="Plant scale"
resourceScalePoster="Poster scale"
resourceScaleDiamond="Diamond scale"
resourceScaleContainer="Container scale"
(via Progression menu > Resource scale menu)

Data:
ih_hostage_pdd5.fpk/d from mis_com_fob_hostage
split to:
ih_hostage_loc - 4 hostage locators

ih_hostage_pdd5_def - TppHostage2 hostage defintion with prs/pdd5_main0_def_v00.parts to match ih_hostage_dd

r194 - 2016-11-18

Fixed: Some defaults not applying on fob.

Fixed: Allow skull types not actually filtering the skulls select - thanks SoullessMadness for the report.

Fixed: (mostly) Allow heavy armor in free/missions, Custom prep with armor % high would cause soldiers either defaulting to non armored or not rendering body.

Refactor: InfUserMarker shifted to external

Debug: Added debugUpdate - pcalls on TppMain.OnUpdate / module updates

InfMain: Added PostModuleReload callback for external modules

Module Additions: ihQuestsInfo,RegisterQuests - pulls together various quest data for easier setup of new quests.

SideOp: quest_q30100 - "Sheep in the Keep" - "Logistics had a mishap and let a herd of sheep loose on the Command Platform. Fulton them so they can take them to the Conservation Platform." 
SideOp: quest_q30101 - "Birds in the Belfry" - "Your staff has been having some issues with birds roosting in the Intel Platform Enclosure. See if you can clear them out." 
SideOp: quest_q30102 - "Rats in the Basement" - "The grow-room under the Support Platform is plagued by rodents.&#xA;Find them among the plants."

https://youtu.be/Xe5VjKC2f9w

Functionality: TppAnimal.CheckQuestAllTarget,TppQuest.Update to allow for quest update notification on multiple animal quest update
Added support for target name list in quest script animallist.

Fixed: Animals camo selectable via the camo option.
Fixed: RETAILBUG: TppAnimal quest assigning ani_questTargetList to exact same tables, which caused issue when trying to assign different messageid in CheckQuestAllTarget
Wasn't actually an issue in retail since there was no quests with more than one animal.
Fixed: Mb puppy no longer disables sideops on Command cluster.
Refactor: As above, mbPuppy shifted from quest Mtbs_child_dog to it's own module/fpk 
Data: ih_puppy.fpk/d built from quest_child_dog.fpk/d
Module: InfPuppy

Fixed: TppQuest.UpdateActiveQuest now using level seed for random or side ops selection mode. This fixes mismatch bettween aparent selected sideop (ui cues) and actual sideop pack/script loaded when directly spawning into a quest load area, possibly a rare issue in free roam, but a clear issue on mother base. Should also prevent the change of sideops from ACC to level.

Data: Fpk \Assets\tpp\pack\ui\lang\lang_default_data_eng.fpk - Assets\tpp\lang\ui\ih_quest.eng.lng2

Data: \Assets\tpp\pack\mission2\quest\ih\ ih_sheep_quest.fpk/d,ih_bird_quest.fpk/d,ih_rat_quest.fpk/d

Refactor: Shifted plain table user files loading to InfLog.LoadBoxed.

Added: Walker gears assigned to foot patrols in free roam (requires both foot patrols and walker gears in free to be enabled) - InfWalkerGears.AddLrrpWalkers,SetUpEnemyGear, pretty flaky with soldiers ditching walkers in the middle of nowhere though, also (if they make it that far), they'll leave it at their destination base instead of continuing with it.

TotalCount in mafr dropped to combat combined pack crash (combinations of soldier/para/walker/heli crash, decreasing totalcounts of the principle game objects fix it. Assuming some memory allocation limit/issue at this point.)
Data: ih_walker_gear_loc.fpk / ih_walker_gear_loc.fox2
Data: walker totalCount dropped to 16 to prevent combo crash
Data: Added sdf file and referencing fox2 to ih_parasite_mist - should hopefully fix the Mist Skulls make not sound issue (even though on my initial test I couldn't reproduce) - thanks angelolujan1 for the report

Debug:
InfLog.StrCode32 - passes through Fox.StrCode32 to a strcode>string lookup table
InfLog.StrCode32ToString - uses above lookup table and TppDbgStr32s system to provide run time StrCode32ToString for registered strings.
Option: debugMessages - prints on message system calls to log.
Returned forced announcelog clear on SetGameStatus to toggled on debugMode, but also not InfLog.doneStartup so it can still show during startup.
Module: InfLookup - consolidated various lookup functions.
InfLog.AddFlow / ivar debugFlow - to mark/log program flow.

Feature: Mist parasites/Sniper Skulls added to Skulls attack feature.

Fixed: Hard crash in some situations with attack heli patrols (possibly with more animals mod? VERIFY), had to reduce number of TppEnemyHeli gameobjects (enemy_heli_<loc>.fox2) from 8 to 4 though :/

Option: Enable QuickMenu, quickmenu is now disabled by default.
Menu: IH system menu - shifted various options related to IH itself here.

Instant flag for Quick menu commands to allow TSM instant activation.
Added Drop current equip on <LIGHT_SWITCH> (X key/Dpad right)

AutoDoc: Features header changed from txt file to table. More features documented.

r184 - 2016-09-26
Fixed: Quick menu should not activate if holding a quick menu command button then holding the quick menu on button(CALL), will only be activated on quick menu on button(CALL) held then pressing a quick menu command button - thanks LucrassKelvac for your report.
I'm aware some people will still have issue with how quick menu is activated, depending on how they play. Quick menu will be much more configurable in comming version.

r183 - 2016-09-24
Fixed: Infinite load screen on traveling between free<>mission for some missions - thanks RealQi for the save file.
Improved: Added delay on quick menu command activation. Should mean less accidental triggering of quick menu commands - thanks RealQi for the prod.

(via Mother Base menu)

Added: Custom soldier equip for Quarantine plat - if you have been using the 'MB staff use custom equip' you will have to set it again this version as the update has reset it.

Exposed: mbEnableLethalActions - Allow lethal actions - Enables lethal weapons and actions on Mother Base. You will still get a game over if you kill staff.
(via Mother Base menu)

r181 
InfMessageLog: Realised I was being stupid and why my prior uses of io failed. message log outputs to file now. God, how many months of me thinking the module was blocked lol - thanks TideGear for putting me in the mindset to test try it again.
Append mode still seems to be no-go, gives 'Domain error', same message most other errors (open 'r' with no file found).
Refactor: InfMessageLog/AddMessage renamed to InfLog/Add. Less typing for something thats going to get a lot of use.
Loading shifted to start of init.lua so it can cover from very start of lua execution.
Refactor: InfInspect reverted to just the kikito inspect (well that and wrapped into module), rest of (actually used) non-inspect module functions shifted to InfLog.
Refactor: InfMenu.DebugPrint shifted to InfMessageLog
Refactor: TryFunc shifted to InfLog.PCall.
Ivars: OnChange,OnActivate,OnSelect wrapped in PCall. The vast majority are initiated by the user through the menu so performance is less of a concern (and now that I have actual logging worth keeping in-place)

r180 - 2016-09-17
Refactor: Completeted weapontable support for tables of weaponids per weapon.
Refactor: _CreateDDWeaponIdTable reverted to vanilla, InfEquip.CreateDDWeaponIdTable take's it's place for dd equip.
Change: DD Equip is now Custom soldier equip
Ivars: customWeaponTable*,weaponTable.
- Allow soldiers to have equipment from other locations/types, including DD equipment usually only used on FOB. Soldiers are assigned a random weapon of the type the prep system assigns them, so you'll see more weapon variation - thanks NasaNhak and others for the suggestion.

r179 - 2016-09-14
Refactor: Decoupled most ivars dependancy on another (such as profile)
Refactor: Removed some Ivars ivar profiles.
Fixed: Crash on exit from title having visited MB during the game session.

Fixed: Enemy phase modifications breaking IH menu in wargames - thanks i-ghost for the report and save file to test.
Option: printOnBlockChange - debug option that prints on block updates.
Reverted: Menu option only print on menu up/down. Too much of an anoyance for little gain.

WIP: Head fova mod support.

r176 - 2016-08-29
Fixed: FOB defender spawning but getting stuck with a black screen, the issue boiled down to svars definition mismatch between client/client - thanks Maniac_34 and i-ghost for helping me with testing.
Refactor: Related to above - inf_interCpQuestStatus reworked due to it's shift from svars.
Fixed: Buddy equip change developed check.
Option: soldierNightSightDistScale - seperate sight scale applied to night
Research: Runtime faceDefinition mod, Soldier2FaceAndBodyData, Ivar. *Fova, InfFova.ApplyFaceFova. Unfortunately SetFaceFovaDefinitionTable crashes the engine if run multiple times.
WIP: resourceAmountScale - Resource amount scale - Since Anyones Tpp improvements mods and other resource mods conflict might as well add it so they don't have to jump through hoops.
Refactor: DisplaySetting shifted to a message que, it doesn't help much lol
Addition: Menu up and down now support bigger increments by holding <Fire>
Change: Menu will only print out the option name, and not the setting while navigating up and down, the auto display shows the full text. This should cut down a little of the text printed/needing to catch up when cycling through the menu.
Reverted: Removed fulton restriction on Invasion. The weirdness is still there, but the odd extraction count seems to be with normal extractions.
Options:  playerType,playerPartsType,playerCamoType,playerFaceEquipId,playerFaceId. Options been there forever, just had it disabled since Threesocks mod was good enough. Now made (mostly) usernice, so user can use Hideo and Big Boss sneaking suit options as well as the FOB camos they have unlocked. Face selection still needs work, rather than having users cycle through hundreds of faces.
Player type - Snake, Avatar, DD Male, DD Female
Suit type - the different suits, will use the Fova lua name if the model swap has included it.
Camo type - Cammo, if the suit supports it
Headgear - The usual mission selectable headgear. Bandanas(Snake/Avatar), Balaclavas etc.
Face - (DD soldiers only), cycle backward to the end to get the more unique faces, including Hideo. 
The previous player headgear (cosmetic) option has been removed, the headgear is in the faces list about a quater from the end.
(via Appearance menu in Player settings menu or in In Mission menu)

r175

Refactor: Majority of settings shifted from mission save slot to config
Seperate save file TPP_CONFIG_DATA_MOD with increased size.

Command: requestHeliLzToLastMarker - Support heli to latest marker
Requests Support heli to Landing Zone closest to the last placed user marker. Can also be used to ride the support heli to another LZ if the IH menu is open and the option is selected when getting into the heli. This however has an issue where the doors will close on take-off preventing you from shifting between heli sides, the chaingun on your side can still be used however.

Fixed: Reverted reserve soldier locators in afgh fox2. Fixes Invisible soldier bodies for amored soldiers in afghanistan sideops - thanks Simonz93 for the report
Don't know why mafr is seemingly fine with more soldiers

r153 - 2016-05-11 - public release
Updated to 1.09 - why on earth did KJP regress the exe version to 1.0.7.1?
mbSoldierEquipGrade - DD Equip Grade increased to 11, so you should you can equip DD or enemies with the new weapons (assuming Allow undeveloped DD equipment is on).

r152
Refactor: Stop a few code paths from running in fob mode to try and fix a potential hang on connect.
Refactor: Male wildcards to use RegisterUniqueSetting, body table in InfEneFova/abomination removed from TppEnemy body table
Male wildcards now use face id table
Added the rarer faces to female face id table

r151
Refactor: Changed most features that used mbfreemission mission checks to just 30050, fixes below
Fixed: Hang after load on Quarantine and Zoo platforms.
Refactor: InfLZ.groundStartPositions sub-tables for mb layouts, existing table to sub-table 1. 
Fixed: Mission 22 - Retake the Platform start of foot position under the water - result of above - thanks NasaNhak for the report
Feature: Walker gears on mother base
Module: InfWalkerGear
Option: enableMbWalkerGears - "Enable walker gears"
Option: mbWalkerGearsColor - "Walker gears type" -
	"Soviet",
	"Rogue Coyote",
	"CFA",
	"ZRS",
	"Diamond Dogs",
	"Hueys Prototype (texture issues)",
	"All gears random of one type",
	"Each gear random type",
Option: mbWalkerGearsWeapon - "Walker gears weapons" -    
	"Even split of weapons",
	"Minigun",
	"Missiles",
	"All gears random of one type",
	"Each gear random type",  
	
(via Mother base Menu)
GOTCHA: They're actually always enabled since the game object instances don't seem to start unrealised like other gameobjects.
Shifted Ocelots start position.
"Attack heli type" renamed "Attack heli class"
Added "All one random type","Each heli random type" to heli class.
Options: vehiclePatrolClass - "Vehicle patrol class" - "Default","Dark grey","Red","All one random type","Each vehicle random type","Enemy prep" 

Data:
f30050_npc.fox2 - added WalkerGearGameObject, usually it's in it's own .fox2 (walkergear_main_enemy ex) in the mission fpkd
f30010_npc.fox2 - added walker gear gobject and locators

r150 - 2016-05-04 - public release
Ivars - minPhase,maxPhase,keepPhase now turns on phaseUpdate
Refactor: Ivar execChecks renamed execCheckTable to prevent name confusion
Fixed: InfMain.ExecUpdate, UpdateExecChecks iterating execCheckTable,execChecks via ipairs instead of pairs - would cause the menu in ACC to break (not enable) on initial load when enemy phase modifications were on - thanks everyone for the reports, and CantStoptheBipBop for the save file
printPhaseChanges changed if phaseUpdate on to stop spam
WIP - disableSpySearch - redacted (heh) since GetGlobalLocationParameter is too restrictive for my liking

r149 - 2016-05-01 - public release
quietMoveToLastMarker - User marker menu > "Quiet move to last marker" - sets a position similar to the Quiet attack positions, but can be nearly anywhere. Quiet will still abort from that position if it's too close to enemies.
"Heli patrols in free roam" settings changed to numerical values.
mbEnablePuppy - Show characters menu > "Enable puppy DDog" - "Off","Missing eye","Normal eyes". Took me a while to figure this out since it was tucked away in a quest, also took a while to track down why it seemed to disable itself which resolved to ClearWithSaveMtbsDDQuest.
Refactor: shifted interrogation resetnormal kludge out of TppInterrogation and unincluded it from the build.
Fixed: No callouts for some DD suit settings.
disableNoStealthCombatRevengeMission  - Prep system menu > "Allow Enemy Prep shift after free roam" - allows enemy prep points shift after free roam
MbVisitDay: Clock message - drives another mb visit reward and the new _ReduceRevengePointByTime
revengeDecayOnLongMbVisit / _ReduceRevengePointByTime - Prep system menu > "Enemy prep decrease on long MB visit" - currently reduces after 3 days (stacking), reduces the same as checken hat use reduction, ie stealth/combat by < 1/4 a level at low revenge levels, and 1/2 at high.

r148 - 2016-04-27 - public release
DDog SetMotherBaseCenterAndRadius increased to cover whole mb (if mbEnableBuddies)
Wildcard soldiers:
Number of wild card soldiers increased
Removed 0 fulton sucess
Feature IH Interrogation: Add some interrogations, can't seem to add new to subps, some other data definition missing I guess.
Travel plans of LRRPs
Locations of wild card soldiers.
Inter CP quest: Sets up pairs of soldiers in different cps, interrogating one will give CP of other, interrogating him will give a reward of unprocessed resources (around a couple of containers worth) or a skull soldier/parasite on the next extraction (reaching checkpoint etc)
Menu: Show characters menu - enable ocelot shifted from mb menu, others shifted from Show assets menu.
Mother base menu> Show characters menu > Reset Paz - Resets Paz state to beginning
Update: Mother base morale boost points now stack, both for visiting several clusters and having many soldiers salute. 

r147 - 2016-04-14 - public release
Feature: Ivar mbMoraleBoosts, various functions in infmain. Mother base menu > "Staff-wide morale boost for visit" Staff wide morale boost on having a number of soldiers salute, or visiting a number of clusters (with at least one salute on each).
Fixed: f30050_sequence, mbWarGamesProfile. Mother base wargames zombie modes will no longer auto fulton wandering soldier style zombies when they retreat to the inter cluster struts.

r146 
Fixed: enemyHeliPatrol options actually affect the number of helis, woops.
Patrol Heli routes:
Fixed: patrol helis no longer chooses route from other location/invalid route.
Fixed: routes where patrol heli couldn't reach the landing node now change route when near.
Longer time between route switch
Will not switch when near arrival
Will switch soon after arrival
Added Wialo Kallai route (afgh)
Added Route near Luftwa Valley (mafr)
Heli patrol known bug: support heli cannot target helis when there's multiple helis in the world.

r145 - 2016-04-07 - public release
Refactor: the mighty ReservePlayerLoadingPosition split assunder, in an attempt to make more readable
Added:   "Start free roam on foot","Start missions on foot","Start Mother base on foot" with: "Off","All but assault LZs","All Lzs" - thanks NasaNhak for the idea
Fixed: PrintMarkerGameObject when nil cpName, added npcHeli names
Freecam: Can now move cam horizontally while in vertical mode.
Freecam: Added move speed scale adjust mode via DASH
Freecam: move scale min decreased, max increased.
Feature: "Heli patrols in free roam" - "None","Min","Mid",Max","Enemy prep". Extension of mb heli patrol, using assault lzs, 
Workaround: bunch of trouble figuring out heli weirdness on checkpoint restore till I realised the heli save state has been brutally pared down to only saving one.
Workaround: disabled wormhole in Invasion, already did so with fulton (or rather set sucess to 0) but didnt remember wormhole doesnt use sucess %, also fixed my workaround applying 0 success if invasion on even if not in motherbase, woops.
Modfpk: heli locators added to free roam fox2s
Modfpk: heli interiors sbh0_intr0_ene.fmdl to reinforce heli fpks, reference in fpkd/fox2



r144
Change: Hand levels min to 0, this will allow disabling of Sonar - thanks vollmerej1 for the suggestion.
Added "Default" to mother base "Attack heli type" - thanks NasaNhak for the idea
Added "Support and Attack helis" to "Enable npc helis", has an issue on checkpoint restart however.
Change: Disable buddies to Disable select buddies in mission prep
Internal: Removed npc heli prepset workaround, issue was update was running before nessesary variables were set up.-
Fixed: Manually opening support heli door on mission start being conflated with disablePullOutHeli
Fixed: Enemy phase options should now work in Wargames.
Refactor: More modules broken out from InfMain
Refactor: Unified IsCheck,ExecCheck to MissionCheck, added a few functions to ease comparing multiple similar ivars that only diferentiate by mission 
Update-Ivars Init support execchecks like UpdateFunc
Refactor: InfNPC split to InfNPCHeli

r144x
Research: FOB Coop - dead-end, "S_DISABLE_TARGET","S_DISABLE_NPC_NOTICE" blocked engine side for player instance 1 - thanks Shigu for suggestion and help testing.

r143 - 2016-03-28 - public release
In-Mission - User marker menu
"Warp to latest marker"
"Print latest marker"
"Print all markers"
setSelectedCpToMarkerObjectCp
Refactor: InfMain broken into several different modules

r142
Fixed: Resetting random seed in addtolrrps, would have knock-on effect to wildcard soldiers.
Fixed: Wildcard powers, was reusing a table instead of copying it, resulted in all being assigned sniper. Thanks Crippsey for the report.
Fixed: Head markers and world markers options interfering with each other - thanks washtubs for the report
Fixed: Player life scale maximum dropped to 750% as it overflows at higher percentage when medical 3 arm is equiped.
Fixed: Don't force reinforce request on if not heli, since it breaks vehicle reinforcements, added as default for free roam since there's an in engine check that stops all vehicle reinforce calls.
Fixed: Start-on foot for transfer between zoo and quarantine - thanks NasaNhak
Fixed: Start on foot Abort now Return to ACC.
Change: Subsistence missions would default to Pure if osp profile was set to default or custom, now it only set to pure if dfault or all weapons set to Use selected - thanks blejky
Fixed: Abort to heli code block being able to be triggered when not in title mode.

r141 - 2016-03-24
Research: armored vehicles on mother base, load fine, just can't get assigned soldiers to stay in them. Think I need to clear their routes but setting routes at runtime isn't working for some reason.
InfFova module, pulled together notes and info from player body vars.
modelInfo lua loading.
Options: enableFovaMod, fovaSelection - built through InfFova.
model swaps and fovas: Masked scarf Snake, Soviets>plparts_dd_male,Pfs>plparts_dd_male

r140 - 2016-03-16 - public release
Updated to MGSV version 1.08 

r139 - 2016-03-14 - public release
Fixed: DD Suit PF All showing corrupted models.
Option: Warp body to FreeCam position
Fixed: Black screen post-load hang on motherbase with DD suit and start-on foot on clusters not fully built out.
Fixed: No staff on motherbase clusters with DD suit on clusters not fully built out. Thanks Crippsey for the report and save file.
Fixed: Repopulated diamonds not giving gmp. Thanks plinkey for the report.

r138 - 2016-03-05 - public release
Fixed: Crash on some vehicle sideops with vehicle patrol on (op 98, possibly 97), missed an attachmentinstancecount in the west_wav_machinegun fox2, oops.

r137
f30050_heli.fox2 added enemyheli locators, rest of definition handled by reinforce fpk
reinforce_heli_mafr fpkd enemy_heli_mafr.fox2 - increased instances to 8
Ivar: mbEnemyHeli
npcHeliUpdate switches to enemyHeliList on mbEnemyHeli
Disable unique characters during wargames (ocelot,eli etc)
Option: mbWargameFemales - "Females in Invasion mode"
Fixed: mbEnableFultonAddStaff, wasn't in right spot and was getting overridden by what it was supposed to override lol, enabled for Invasion wargame
Added RegisterMissionBaseStaffTypes 30050 to start2nd so I don't modify MbmCommonSetting.lua and tread on other mods toes. Invasion missions should get normal range of soldier ranks.
Option: mbEnemyHeliColor - "Heli type in Invasion mode"
Workaround: Fulton disable on Invasion. There's some weirdness with add tempstaff count off, still happens with manual heli extract but at least the soldiers seem to be capped right.

r136
Mother base colletables (diamonds,plants) repopulate, requires helicopter exits from mother base as pause menu abort skips the repop count decrement (you need to do that anyway if you want to save any actions you made while on motherbase). Takes several visits before repop, the same as the normal game, but at least may give you some incentive to roam motherbase and zoo for them again.
f30050_heli.fox2 added westheli, westheli usually has it's own fox2 but the custom fpkd issue still remains.
Feature: npcHeliUpdate - enables 3 TppOtherHelis in mother base, update function manages routes around Mb

r135 - 2016-03-05 - public release
Wildard soldiers: Number of soldiers incread to #Cps/5, number of females increased to 2.
mbDontDemoDisableOcelot removed.
Option: mbEnableOcelot - runs an update function to enable/warp and set a route for ocelot on motherbase
Decreased alphaDistance on free cam to 0.1, should be able to get closer to character without them fading out.

r134
veh_rl_*.fpkd/*fox2 - bodyInstances,attachmentInstanceCount increased to 4. 1 - player vehicle + 2 (quests max) + 1 patrol. 
These packs are actually for the player vehicle but I'm loading them to get the patrol vehicles to work, the veh_mc* packs in common don't actually have ready-to-go data definitions. Editing data is falling into 'not default by default' behaviour which I don't really like, but there's not many options. In the past I tried rolling my own packs but there's issues with fpkds with fox2s (can see this by unpacking an fpkd changing the gztool file pack xml order and repacking) that lead to crashes or extreme memory leaks (like several gb of memory in a minute).

Blockquests: removed armor vehicle quest block on vehicle patrol
Regression: Patrol vehicle spawn type random to level seed
Refactor: TppEnemyFova> break out WildCardFova
Added full range of female faces to wildcard females

r133 - 2016-03-01 - public release
Fixed: Head markers off did not work on heli entry - thanks washtubs for the report.
Option: disableWorldMarkers - thanks brunovisk114 for the suggestion
In mission menu: playerRestrictionsInMissionMenu
MB suit male: SOVIET_ALL, PF_ALL

r132
Patrols setup refactor - shifted to OnInitializeTop, all now modify the missionTable scripts directly since they are unloaded/reloaded anyway.
AddToLrrp split into ModifyPatrolVehicleSoldiers, AddLrrp
Option: enableWildCardFreeRoam
Wildcard - added weapon and body tables, AddWildCard, decided to just replace existing soldier due to: Adding soldiers being unreliable, will allow me to add feature to all missions without having to add extra soldiers to fox2s (assuming I can do it in a way that doesn't interfere with mission critical soldiers).
Free mission .sdfs: add other soldier soundbanks


r131 - 2016-02-22 - public release
Fixed: Hang of FOB all load, thanks SoullessMadness for the report. FOB defense hang on load unconfirmed since it's hard to test.
Vehicle Patrols: Improved soldier assignment, Soldier assigned from reserve pool to fill rnd min(2,vehicleSeats),vehicleSeats (seats defined in base vehicle info), soldier already assigned above seat count get put into pool.
Gives more variation, allows jeeps to have up to 4 people, fixes sillyness with tanks stopping, dropping off a dude, then attacking.
NOTE: all other vehicles than crash on setrelativevehicle if soldiers assigned > 2. APCs carrying are handled differently.
Also hits the same non realize bug as below, soldiers do sometimes finally realize. Vehicle will initially drive off as if it's full, but if soldier realizes will wait till soldier reaches it an gets in.
Don't know if it's something due to my method of warping to soldiers for testing.
Changed from saving/restoring vehicle type enum from svar to random by same seed, vehicle basicType is stored in mvar.
Options: lrrpSizeFreeRoam min, max, disabled for now to get decent coverage

r130
Option: mbPrioritizeFemale, by default the game tries to put a minimum of 2 female DD on that cluster (from that cluster), MAX bumps it to MAX_STAFF_NUM_ON_CLUSTER, so basicall all the females you have, does not include Command cluster, None clears the staff selection of females
Option: mbDDSuitFemale, extendedparts does work independently so was relatively painless
More options for DD Suit, Soviet berets, hoodies, PF misc, using the unique quest/mission bodies from missions/quests.

r129
Fixed: Missing Tpp.IsUav, kjp decided to add this at some point even though there's an identical IsUAV. May fix the incorrect or unregistered fob fulton task types.
Option: enableLrrpFreeRoam - bunch of soldier locators added to free roam fox2s which are assigned a cp(lrrp) and a travelplan between two randomly chosen bases.
Some odd things: Setting to coppied travelplans often causes soldier to not realize (even with force enable and realize), adding too many copied travelplans to the mission luas breaks the normal vehicle lrrps (soliers still spawn but thy wont get in vehicle)

r128 - 2016-02-11 - public release
Expanded mbDDSuit to Xof, Soviet a/b, PF a/b/c
ddBodyInfo extended to include soldiersubtype, hasHeadgear renamed helmetOnly, noDDHeadgear, hasHelmet, hasFace to allow various combinations of dd headgear and model gear.
f30050_npc: add reinforce_block scriptblock
add more corpse game objects, mother base only had 2, interesting note: also corpse system seems keeps one in reserve or something
vox_f30050.sdf - soundbank load refs for enemy_af/mafr/zombie added
mbts_enemy, override soldiertype depending on GetCurrentDDBodyInfo
GetSoldierType, GetSubsoldier - override depending on currentddbody
mbEnableLethal - enable lethal actions on motherbase
mbEnableFultonAddStaff
mbNonStaff - also no demon points increase on mbnonstaff kills
No game over on soldier die in mother base when mbwargames and enablelethal
disableCamText
mbWarGames->mbWarGamesProfile, toggling some of above, the individual settings are currently non-user facing.

r127
Percentage floats changed to int, will fall into uint8/16, saves save file space
Fixed: SetPercentagePowersRange using orphaned/prior name of SetMinMax, since it was called by revengeConfigProfile.WIDE it's likely that it wouldnt set its subsettings.
Fixed: Custom enemy prep clear armor if it can't be used.
Custom config bypass some (config wide) combination restrictions, namely shield and missile, shotgun and mg in same config.
Made allowmissileweapon combo actually work, and not just allow assault, decided to not allow with mg though

r126
Camera refactor:
Cam edit mode and current cam split.
Player cams for each stance/move mode
Ivars for cam variables. This is where I seem to have hit the save file limit, no, just unrelated varables acting odd as if forgotten or overflowed.
Research/deminification of TppSave and other save functions, bumping the save size for the mission category is likely to be a reciepie for disaster since it combines categories in one file and it's smack in the middle of some. Looks like I could add my own save file if I could add a category, but categories ar pow2 and max is at 255 suggesting there's no room even if it would just accept the field from lua/not require it in exe, or it would be if mgo category didn't fit into this scheme, but then that's only defined in mgo exe.

r125
Refactor InfMenuDefs, on table build adds reset settings and go back items
Fixed: Mb cutscene time using hour setting for minute.
Split Enemy use DD equipment into Free roam and Missions
Fixed: noOnChangeSub also blocking OnChange for profiles - basically any profile that set other profiles was broken.
Fixed: Wormhole disable was reversed, also renamed to Wormhole Level since it's the same implementation as Fulton Level
Option: soldierHearingDistScale

r124 - 2015-01-30 - public release
mbWargames: Zombie mode - mixes regular puppet and msf.
Options: disableRetry, gameOverOnDiscovery - to replicate total stealth settings

r123
InfButton: some bitmasks added/renamed to proper from lua, don't seem to be in the playerpad section in the exe though
Refactor InfMenu refresh current setting now combined with Activate (ACTION key)
MenuOn/Off() -> OnActivate OnDeactivate
Activate/deactivate checks > CheckActivate
revengeModeForMb check moved out of IsNoRevengeMission to selectrevengetype itself so it doesnt cause any revenge points change.
Refactor
Added free cam mode, similar implmentation to warp mode but disabling normal controls via padmask to open up keys for own use.
Menu open equip disableActionFlag now bit flipping instead of just saving/restoring previous. Still have odd issues when trying to mix with multiple disables (with free cam for example) seemingly flipping unrelated flags.
Update-ivars now (manually in Onchange) call an OnActivate/Deactivate, key repeat settings shifted there instead of in update.


r122 - 2016-01-23 - public release
Headmarkers should remain disabled in all situations, hopefully - thanks Psithen for the report
Refactor: blocking quests due to reinforcement and patrol vehicle settings via unlockSideOpNumber and TppQuest.UpdateActiveQuest unified to InfMain.BlockQuest. unlockSideOpNumber now silently skips.
"ACTIVE_DECOY","GUN_CAMERA" added to custom config
Mb wargames non-lethal extended to custom config.

r121
Option: revengeModeForMb - "Mother base prep mode" - "Off","FOB style","Enemy prep levels","Custom prep"
Options: mbDemoOverrideTime, mbDemoOverrideWeather - thanks qwertyuiop1234567899 for the suggestion
Various renames to solidify terms:
Subsistence Mode renamed Subsistence profile to match other uses of the term in the menu, and since that's what the varable has been named for months lol.
Free mode to Free roam, mode should be a term reserved for specific behaviour, possibly with multiple settings.
Profile is a curated set of option settings.

r120
Option: enableSoldiersWithVehicleReinforce
IsDDBodyEquip to make body/headgear independant from mbSoldierEquipGrade
Refactor: MinMaxIvar for creating such paired ivars.
Refactor: mbSoldierEquipGrade split to min, max, changed to grade value 1-10
Option: allowUndevelopedDDEquip
Options: enableMbDDEquip, enableEnemyDDEquip, replace mbSoldierEquipGrade 0/OFF, drives IsDDEquip
Option: enableEnemyDDEquip - overrides weaponIdTable with DD

r119 - 2016-01-17 - public release
Ivars - subName, PushMin, PushMax to handle adjusting paired ivars.
Reworking of custom prep menu order and item names.

r118
Change remove demon to subtract demon points, less ideal since there's no feedback of current value so cant tell the lower bounds, but it works for people the prior method didn't - thanks drkcrstl for the feedback
Custom prep profile with wide,max,min, max replaces prior revenge level based max.
SetCustomRevengeUiParameters as rough indication of custom prep config.

r117
InfMenu: support for function call OnActivate when pressing action on selected option.
Reasearch into Player.ChangeEquip
Test of quiet humming command, result: only for boss quiet game object, sad.
Welcome message added for entering acc from title.
Ivars: support for IsCheck on named setting :Is
Option: disableNoRevengeMissions
Custom revenge config: WIP most individual revenge config settings settable
Refactor: A number of gvar instead of ivar references missed in the prior refactor
Disallow menu if in carboard box

r116 - 2015-12-30 - public release
Un-fixed a Retail bug, the game is apparently relying on it's broken behavior lol. Manifested as: Some end of cutscene loadscreen hangs, prologue/truth post heli hallway non-trigger. Possibly much more.

r115 - 2015-12-27 - public release
Fixed: AddPowerSetting, was trashing it by using same name in two variables, the perils of deminification. Possibly affected fob soldier settings.
Powersettings to DD headgear
Load screen splashes reverted to base game. Kjp did too much voodoo in respect to the Nvidia splash screen for me to be happy with touching it.

r114
Refactor: complete ivar get, removed fobs reset settings - instead returns off/default on ivar access.
Refactor: mbDDsuit - pull various body setup data to single table ddBodyInfo and reference that

r113
Regression Fixed: in mission menu when on buddy (horse,walker) - thanks Crotaro for report
Refactor: ivar get via ivar functions instead of gvar value (started, not yet complete)
Option: revengeProfile, default, heaven - to manage the profusion of revenge ivars
Option: enableMgVsShotgunVariation
Option: randomizeSmallCpPowers

r112
Options: disableMissionsWeaponRestriction, disableMotherbaseWeaponRestriction -> revenge CANNOT_USE_ALL_WEAPON_MISSION
Ivar:Is/OptionIsSetting support direct value insead of only enum
Option: balanceWeaponPowers - WIP
Option: allowMissileWeaponsCombo
Option: disableConvertArmorToSheild
Refactor: InfMain.GetSumBalance, InfMain.BalancePowers, CreateCpConfig split from TppRevenge._ApplyRevengeToCp
Command: debug - forceAllQuestOpenFlagFalse
Refactor: various options now communicated to ApplyPowerSetting via soldierConfig

r111 - 2015-12-19 - public release
Fixes to ResetSettings, as a result also fixes FOB loading.

r110 - 2015-12-18 - public release
Update to TPP 1.0.7.0

r109
Options: changeCpSubTypeFree, changeCpSubTypeForMissions
Refactor: InfMenu. Next/PrevSetting/ChangeSetting. Support <ivar>.GetNext(), <ivar>.GetSettingText()

r108
Vehicle patrols changed to using releif vehicle(player vehicle) fpks
Option: allowHeadGearCombo - calculates cp config a second time with headgear combinations allowed.
Option: balanceHeadGear - adjust

r107
Option: vehiclePatrolPackType, switches between quest packs and custom fpks - thanks blejky for the report

r106 - 2015-12-14 - public release
ig_*.fpk/ fpkd. Initially started as copies of the respective quests I was using to get proper vehicle references for patrol vehicles, since using the quest fpks directly intereferes with quests - still not exactly sure what aspect, guessing the quest script block load given it went away when I deleted it, but tests showed the script itself wasn't loaded, so guessing the script block entity in the fox2 got engaged, don't know.
Stripping down the packs further revealed some troublesome issues with fox2 files relying on specifc file orders, or possibly something more.
Fixed: (due to above) vehicle patrols interfering with sideops - thanks blejky for the report

r105
Fixed: Reset all settings was completely broken, varable but didnt cat all instances woops.
Options: applyPowersToOuterBase, applyPowersToLlrp.

r104
Options: allowHeavyArmorInFreeMode, allowHeavyArmorInAllMissions - currently armor has the same bug as mb armor where hits act like the armor isnt there, still same shots as non armor and no spang sounds of bullets hitting armor.
Options:
fultonSuccessMenu="Fulton success menu"
fultonSuccessProfile="Fulton success profile",
fultonSuccessSettings={"Default","Heaven","Custom"},

r103 - 2015-12-10 - public release
Fixed: Vehicle patrol all of one type loading hang - thanks mgs5tppfan for the report

r102 - 2015-12-09 - public release
Commands: setDemon, removeDemon - thanks PIESOFTHENORTH for the suggestion
Refactor: Removed Item suffix from non menu item names.
Fixed: patrol vehicle enable types not rebuilding enabled list.
Research options:
vehiclePatrolClass
vehiclePatrolPaintType
vehiclePatrolEmblemType
SetPatrolSpawnInfo, revert to default/unmodified painttype, currently only jeeps and trucks using.
Fixed: forceSuperReinforce out of bounds
Disabled random emblem splashes to see if it's cause of various reported issues.

r101 - 2015-12-09 - public release
Fixed: xraymarkers
Fixed: A case of the Display menu not showing for some saves, possibly had other ramifications.

r100 - 2015-12-08 - public release
vehicle patrol vehicle type saving - svar array vehiclePatrolSpawnedTypes, ModifyVehicleSpawn split into PreSpawnVehicle, RestoreVehiclePatrol, ModifyVehicleSpawn
A few iterations till I got this right, was a gvar with a custom clear function, mission svar seems the better way to go though.

r99
vehicleBaseTypes/ModifyVehicleSpawn refactored to select from ivars/location.
Options:
vehiclePatrolDistribution - off, singular, each
vehiclePatrolLvEnable
vehiclePatrolTruckEnable
vehiclePatrolWavEnable
vehiclePatrolWavHeavyEnable
vehiclePatrolTankEnable

r98
InfMain vehicleSpawnInfoTable initial thrash out, ModifyVehicleSpawn() to intercept TppEnemy.SpawnVehicle
Research: None of the fpks you'd expect - COMMON_whatever vehicle, or even reinforce fpks - actually seem to have full references/setup whatever of the mentioned vehicles, quest fpks do however. Built list of fpks for vehicle types.
Fixes to force reinforce I inadvertantly introduced when cleaning up.

r97
Fixed: <Stance> in support heli not setting pull out in mother base
Feature: <Stance> in support heli now a (non saving) toggle for pull-out, requires you to jump out after setting hold though.
Option: Start on foot reworked to spawn at selected lz on mother base platforms - thanks to NasaNhak for pointer
Feature: Abort to Heli from title continue. Hold down ESCAPE for 1.5 seconds, the kjp logo will flash, clickin on continue will load ACC instead of continuing mission.
Research: Vehicle swap. Vehicle spawning seems pretty loose, the issue is the assets/fpk loading.

r96
OnTimer_FinishReinforce firing on reinforce heli LostControl and reinforce vehicle VehicleBroken, resets heavy reinforce so it can retrigger
heliReinforceChance changed to switch enableHeliReinforce, will revisit if I get vehicle reinforcement more consistant
Disable super reinforce in free till can figure it out.
Option: forceReinforceRequest
Known Bug: Reinforce heli will spawn with combat alert, you'll hear the ! and it doing a round of attack even though it's far away.
Option: disableReinforceHeliPullOut, currently have no way to tell if heli has left so cant reset reinforce if it has, this at least removes one case

r95
Fixed: turn off menu when in ground vehicle
Option: soldierAlertOnHeavyVehicleDamage - changes phase of soldiers CP on damage, independant from Ivars.phaseUpate
printPhaseChanges - now via message, so independant from Ivars.phaseUpate, includes cpid and prevPhase, spams a bit more though.
Option: useSoldierForDemos now covers allowing selected character in Diamond Dogs and Shining Lights missions - thanks NasaNhak and Solidcal for the suggestions.
InfMenuDefs: useSoldierForDemos also added to playerSettingsMenu
Fixed: Mission timer on Backup Back Down (10054,11054) would not start, startOnFoot now SetIsStartFromFreePlay - thanks NasaNhak the report.
Fixed: changing subsistence profile would flip it to Custom via unsupressed onsubsettingchanged.
Tonne of deminification

r94
Option: WIP: forceVehicleReinforce, heliReinforceChance - heli reinforcment initially working, vehicles aparently have a lot of setup in the engine I'm missing out on, but work for some actual missions not in the usual reinforce mission list.
InfMain: support for game message system - Messages(), OnMessage(), Init and Reload build messageExecTable
Refactor: various settings/functions called in Tpp* message functions now via infmain messages.
playerHealthScale (and enemyhealtscale) reduced to 900%, hit some odd overflow/wrap limit I think.

r93
Player and enemy health scale option upper bounds increased to 1000%
Fixed: Use selected soldier in cutscenes should catch all of them now - thanks VickoStojanov for the report.
Message added to headgear to make clearer it only works for DD soliders - thanks gOKU1983 for the report.
Fixed: not being able to select weapon when toggling warp mode.
Fixed: returning to ACC while in vehicle or on buddy preventing mod menu from opening.
Research: vehicle reinforcement, various things blocking the way, a mission list check, surprisingly few missions used it, quest helis actually use part of the system, and the actual vehicle reinforce setup isn't called in free mode.

r92 - 2015-11-25 - public release
Thought I was done with heli? Ho ho.
UpdateHeli > manually open door on mission start by pressing <STANCE>, a fun combo is to set 'Mission start open door wait time' to a max and just ride in first person, then pop out whenever you want.
Start missions on foot shifted to support heli menu.
NOTE: Aparently DisablePullOut overrides the motherbase taxi service, use the <STANCE> to disable then hit the usual <EVADE> to open the taxi menu
Option: setSearchLightForcedHeli - ok really Disable search light, but the ivar name is closer to command name
Order recieved announclog for a couple of heli settings.

r91
disableHeliAttack - switch via OnChange, so now can update in-mission,
activation block in TppMain.Oninitialize now InfMain.UpdateHeliVars
Option: setInvincibleHeli
Option: DisablePullOut
Command: PullOut
Feature: Force heli pull-out by pressing STANCE while in heli.
Various other heli commands explored that turned out not useful.
InfMain.SplashStateCallback_r, tying in with RandomEmblemSplash to have splashes cover the load period (like the original splashes did that I rashly killed lol), splashes do not block loading, there is a hit however long the splash texture load is though.
title_sequence - kills off the current random splash, title_sequence usually wait for the normal splashes (that I removed), but in practice they were usually done by then (so I can't really claim any loading speed improvement) and I think the nvidia splash was added to cover the rest.

r90
Splash screens added to start/end of start.lua, end one is a good indicator that the main luas have loaded/compiled ok and from that point on its onto init mission/init_squence
InfMain.DeleteSplash
InfMain.RandomEmblemSplash
Refactor: InfMain.Update > ExecUpdate - phaseUpdate and warpPlayerUpdate using unified update system.
Ivar: enablePhaseMod renamed phaseUpdate - users will have to redo their setting

r89
Refactor:InfSoldierParams, soldierParamsProfile, soldierHealthScale - various renaming, shifting block out of TppMain
Option: soldierSightDistScale
Options: *DistScaleSightParam - incomplete, still don't know the approach to take here, there's a heck of a lot of settings in SoldierParameterTables, how granular do I want to let the user mod this? scale vs exact value? managing profiles (something closer to TPPHC)?
Command: printSightFormParameterItem
Command: printhealthTableParameterItem
Fixed: Refresh current setting (tapping mod menu button) not checking if it was an actual setting (menu) (would do no harm only wanring message, I knew I put it there for a reason)
Project: MockTest - why didn't I think of this sooner.
Ivar.enemyPrameters renamed soldierParamsProfile, now a profile to soldierHealthMult(also renamed) and  soldierSightDistScale

r88
Fixed: Menu off when iDroid open improved
Ivars: Is/OptionIsSetting catch case of no enum
IsDefault added
OnSubSettingChanged - doesnt flip profile if subsetting is default or profile is default or custom
Option: defaultHeliDoorOpenTime
InfMain.Update - common execution check flags expanded, passed to the various mod feature update functions
Option:quietRadioMode

r87
Command: warpPlayerMode
Refactor: InfMenu.EndFadeIn, FinishOpeningDemoOnHeli - pull in stuff from TppMission msgs
Option: disableXrayMark - buddies that mark still cause the effect though.
InfMenuDef allTables setup check IfTable
Equip menu disabled on menu open -- playerWarpMode messes with it though
ButtonRepeat enabled on navigate up/down menu.
Should improve the experience a bit for gamepad bros.
InfMenu - disable state extended from menus to all options

r86 - 2015-11-19 - public release
Fixed: A few cutscenes I broken in r56, oops

Option: mbDontDemoDisableOcelot expanded to more cases
Fixed: remebered to update in-game version string lol

r85 - 2015-11-19 - public release

Fixed: some unexposed appearence settings running on set-to-default, manifested as player changing to snake, olive drab on FOB.
Fixed: fulton being set to level 1 on mission start
- thanks GaKoDuck for the reports

r84
Refactor: InfMain.Update - Phase mod broken to own function, InfButton.UpdateHeld(),InfButton.UpdatePressed() shifted from InfMenu.Update, InfMenu.Update now called from InfMain.Update instead of TppMain.
Refactor: DebugPrint split and print strings larger than Announcelog limit
Command: warpPlayerCommand - just initial testing with hard coded positions.
Command: Unlock weapon customisation - game progression unlock
Command: Exting unlock player avatar changed from Ivar to command - not that there's much difference, the deliniation is ivar is it's own setting, and almost always saved, command does a thing, and doesn't care about it's own state, in this case we're just setting another game var.
Fixed: Phase mod disabled for mother base. MB is not set up for caution routes aparently, also even with friendly set they will go hostil on alert

r83
clockTimeScale upper bound increased
Option: telopMode - Disable mission intro credits
Side project: scraper for langId dictionary

r82
mbLayout - research, not much result, mostly used for fob missions I think, doesn't seem to be any actual geometry changes.
manualMissionCode,loadMissionItem - not much use, the 'no number missions' are supposed to be hard versions of some missions, but I see no evidence that they actually have custom changes.

r81
Extend mbEnableBuddies to Zoo
Zoo plants should repop.

r80 - 2015-11-17 - public release

r68
Ivars: Setting/getting via .Set, Is, Above, BelowOrIs...
Ivars: settingsTable for custom function per setting, either run on setting change, or value return via ivar.data()
Ivars: SubSetting>parent profile OnSubSettingChanged, just notifies user and sets profile to CUSTOM. Too much effort to do subsettings combination validation for now.
Option: ospWeaponLoadout now ospWeaponProfile with the original Pure, Secondary
Subsettings: to ospWeaponLoadout - primary/secondary/tertiaryWeaponOsp

r67
Command: showequipgrade
InfHooks added, test out another to keep my impact on other files minimized, though at this point with no other substantial mods and it being unlikely that there will be many more patches I don't know why.
