--tex fpks and fpkds must be paired in the fox engine, ie if you have one, you must have the other.

MakeBite/Snakebite is fine if you create an empty <packname>_fpk(d) folder, but git doesn't check in empty folders.

Now you could just create the empty pack itself and check that in, but that can make things confusing to keep track of remembering why it's there, not accidentally deleting it with other fpks generated by makebite.

So the solution I'm using is just to have a file in the 'empty' folder (this file).
git will check it in, makebite will ignore .txt files in fpks, and this file also includes the explanation why.
Just remember to delete this if you do actually put files in the pack in the future.
