Infinite Heaven provides a framework for many addons (mods that add to base game or IH features)  

This folder (<game dir>\mod\docs\Infinite Heaven\Addons) has documents and examples that describe them.  

Generally an addon will add an info lua script in a specific folder in the <game dir>\mod folder.  
In documentation and comments these are usually either refered to as <addon type> addon file or <addon type>Info.   
Subfolders of this folder with addon example are named after the specific addon folders, otherwise they will be noted in the document for the type of addon.
