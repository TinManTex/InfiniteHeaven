Settings save file.
IH writes its settings to ih_save.lua in the MGS_TPPmodsaves folder.
While the file is editable, editing an inMission save is likely to cause issues.

Profiles.
Editable lists of options as an alternative to using the in game IH menu, see the \mod\profiles folder in your MGS_TPP game folder.

Reload lua scripts in MGS_TPP without exiting game.
Hold <Stance>,<Action>,<Ready weapon>,<Binoculars> (Can also use the loadExternalModules command in the Debug menu)

New sideops for Mother Base.
(Optional Files) Adds 3 new animal capture sideops for Mother Base. Make sure you've cleared the target training sidops for the clusters or they may not show.

IHExt overlay
IHExt is an overlay app that Infinite Heaven can launch to act as the menu when MGSV is in Borderless Fullscreen mode.
The normal IH activation and navigation of the menu remains the same, but if you alt-tab to the overlay you can use mouse and keyboard to more quickly navigate and change settings. It can also display more descriptive help text for the current option. Can also search by selecting the menu line below the menu list, typing something and pressing enter.
Enable via the IH System menu.
